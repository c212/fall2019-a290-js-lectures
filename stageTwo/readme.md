# Stage Two Example/In Class #
This will contain what we go over in class plus a possible stage two example.  

## What we Need ##
* Intrinsic World Dynamics Demonstrated.  
* Understanding of the code.  

## Step 1: Understanding ##  
*What is intrinsic world dynamics?*
**Intrinsic World Dynamics** are actions that happen in the world without the user causing them to happen.  
An example of this would be [the clock we saw in HW 05] (https://cs.indiana.edu/~dgerman/a290-js/spr2019/hw05.pdf "HW05").
We will take a look at this clock in class.  

## Step 2: Working Through It ##  

## Step 3: Demonstration ##  

## Notes ##
