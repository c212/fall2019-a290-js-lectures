# Final Exam Explanation/In-Class #
This will go over what we talk about in class.  

## What we Need ##
* code (all files in your github.com/c212/fall2019-js-... repository).  
* instructions (the steps I need to take to make your code run for me).  
  * This can be as the README.md or as its own file titled "Instructions".  

## Step 1: Angular ##
Follow [the tutorial for Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/ "Angular Tutorial") to have an understanding of it.   
Then, [checkout this application](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_application.asp) from the tutorial.  

## Step 2: MongoDB ##
Add a MongoDB backend to it, such as we did [on November 20th in class](http://silo.cs.indiana.edu:8346/a290-web/fall2016/0929a.phps "MongoDB").  

## Notes ##
* You may have to switch between node 6 and node 10, depending on what you are working on. Checkout the [whats new from december 3rd](https://cs.indiana.edu/classes/a290-js/fall2019/whatsnew.html "Whats new").
